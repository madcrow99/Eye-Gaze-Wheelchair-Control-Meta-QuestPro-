# Eye-Gaze-Wheelchair-Control-Meta-QuestPro-
***work in progress***
This project is for educational purposes and not intended to be used in real world scenarios. Do not use any part of this repository to drive/operate a wheelchair. No part of this repository guaranteed or warrented to work even as intended.

This project uses the eye tracking and colour pass-through features available on the Meta Quest Pro to control a power wheelchair. My hope is that the eye tracking will work in all lighting conditions. My current solution uses windows eye control and works well indoors but completely stops working outdoors.***to do: create repository for windows eye control powerchair project.
